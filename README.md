	sjBot is easily extendable, adding commands or plugins is a breeze.
	If you plan to use this, you will need to register you own bot account at freenode.
	Put the password in the keys file under sjbot_pass. You will also need
	to use a different api key for everything since i did not
	include mine. I can't have just anyone using my keys, sorry.
	
	Please read the PDF file for more info on how to make a plugin
